### 7.4.5: Adapt WebAssembly Function `mj_plot`

Now that the UI and Web Worker side of things is done, we finally need to change function `mj_plot` to run in such a way that multiple instances of itself can run without trampling on each other.

This means two fundamental changes need to be made (one of which is very simple):

1. The value of the pixel currently being plotted must be held in shared memory.

   This means that function `mj_plot` can no longer use private index counters such as `$x_pos` and `$y_pos` to keep track which row and column is currently being worked on.  Instead, the next pixel to be calculated must be read from shared memory, incremented, then written back again as an ***atomic operation***.  This is known as an atomic read-modify-write (`atomic.rmw`) operation.

   In this manner, multiple instances of the function `mj_plot` can read their next pixel from shared memory, increment it and write it back again without duplicating the work of any other `mj_plot` instance.

1. Function `mj_plot` is currently structured as a nested loop.  We first loop around all the rows in the image, then within each row, we loop around each column.  Hence the need for two internal index counters `$x_pos` and `$y_pos`.

   This is fine when there's only one instance of `mj_plot` running, but now that multiple instances will all be running in parallel, we cannot safely perform two atomic read-modify-write operations and expect the values of `$x_pos` and `$y_pos` to remain related to each other.

   What we now need to do instead is store a single pixel counter value in shared memory that represents the current pixel being worked on.  This value will continue to grow until it reaches the total number of pixels in the image (I.E. `$pixel_count = $width  * $height`).

   Each instance of `mj_plot` can then safely read-modify-write this single value.

   > ***IMPORTANT***
   > After each image has been plotted, this pixel counter must be reset to 0.
   >
   > This action is not performed in the WebAssembly coding, but in the main thread's message handler when it detects that all the workers have finished.

### Modifying Module `mj_plot`

In the same way that we needed to change the `memory` declaration in the `colur_palette` module, we must declare that module `mj_plot.wat` will use shared memory.

```wast
(module
  (import "js" "shared_mem" (memory 46 46 shared))

  ;; snip
)
```

### Modifying Function `mj_plot`

The first thing we need to establish is where in shared memory the pixel counter lives.  Here, we are free to choose any locations we like - so long as everyone looks in the same place!  We are plotting two fractal images, so we need two pixel counters: one for the Mandelbrot Set and the other for the Julia Set.

For simplicity, both pixel counters will be `i32` values and live at offsets `0` and `4` for the Mandelbrot and Julia Sets respectively.  This in turn means that the previous memory location of the Mandelbrot image data (offset zero) must be shifted down by 8 bytes.

So first we create some local variables to keep track of how many pixels need to be calculated, what the current pixel is, and where in memory can I find the next pixel value.

The following code snippets show the relevant changes to function `mj_plot`.  So right at the start, we need to add:

```wast
(local $pixel_count i32)
(local $this_pixel i32)
(local $next_pixel_offset i32)

;; How many pixels in total need to be calculated?
(local.set $pixel_count (i32.mul (local.get $width) (local.get $height)))

;; Pick up the shared memory location of the next pixel to render
;; Next Mandelbrot Set pixel - offset 0
;; Next Julia Set pixel      - offset 4
(local.set $next_pixel_offset
  (if (result i32)
    (local.get $is_mandelbrot)
    (then (i32.const 0))
    (else (i32.const 4))
  )
)
```

Previously, we used the internal `$x_pos` and `$y_pos` counters to control a nested loop:

```wast
(loop $rows
  ;; Continue plotting rows?
  (if (i32.gt_u (local.get $height) (local.get $y_pos))
  (then

    (loop $cols
      (if (i32.gt_u (local.get $width) (local.get $x_pos))
      (then
        ;; snip
      )
    ) ;; end of $cols loop
  )
) ;; end of $rows loop
```

Now, we simply have a single loop that performs an atomic read-modify-write on the next pixel value in shared memory, then converts that pixel number to the correct row and column coordinates (`$cy` and `$cx` respectively):

```wast
(loop $pixels
  ;; Continue plotting pixels?
  (if (i32.gt_u
    (local.get $pixel_count)
    (local.tee $this_pixel
      (i32.atomic.rmw.add (local.get $next_pixel_offset) (i32.const 1))
    )
  )
  (then
    ;; Convert x position to x coordinate
    (local.set $cx
      (f64.add
        (local.get $cx_int)
        (f64.div
          ;; Derive x position from $this_pixel
          (f64.convert_i32_u (i32.rem_u (local.get $this_pixel) (local.get $width)))
          (local.get $ppu)
        )
      )
    )
    ;; Convert y position to y coordinate
    (local.set $cy
      (f64.add
        (local.get $cy_int)
          (f64.div
            ;; Derive y position from $this_pixel
            (f64.convert_i32_u (i32.div_u (local.get $this_pixel) (local.get $width)))
            (local.get $ppu)
          )
        )
      )
    )

    ;; snip

  )
) ;; end of $pixels loop
```

Notice the `i32.atomic.rmw.add` statement.  This is the read-modify-write statement that performs three operations as an atomic unit:

1. It reads an `i32` value from the offset in shared memory found in the first argument (`$next_pixel_offset`) and pushes it onto the stack
1. It then adds the value found in the second argument (`i32.const 1`)
1. The result of the addition is written back to the same location in shared memory

The result is that the original value is now on the top of the stack ready for use, and the incremented value is available in shared memory to be read and acted upon by some other thread.

Next, we convert the value of `$this_pixel` into the corresponding row (`$cy`) and column (`$cx`) coordinates using some precalculated intermediate values stored in `$cy_int` and `$cx_int`.

Now that we have derived the correct X and Y coordinates, we simply continue as before...
