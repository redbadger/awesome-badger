# Rui Ramos

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Rui Ramos](https://ruiramos.com) and I've been a Tech Lead at Red Badger since May 2020. It's been good times!

I'm passionate about the web and building software that's simple, usable and useful. I also have a couple of side-projects with funny names like [Great DJ!](https://great.dj), [typr.club](https://typr.club) or [progress.bot](https://progress.bot). I hope they still work!

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/ruiramos) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ruimramos).
